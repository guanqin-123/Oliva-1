  branching:
    method: kfsb  # Branching heuristic. babsr is fast but less accurate; fsb is slow but most accurate; kfsb is usually a balance; kfsb-intercept-only is faster but may lead to worse branching; sb is fast smart branching which relies on the A matrix.
    candidates: 5  # Number of candidates to consider when using fsb or kfsb. More candidates lead to slower but better branching.
    reduceop: min  # Reduction operation to compute branching scores from two sides of a branch (min or max). max can work better on some models.
